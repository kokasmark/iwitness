## What is it?

**iWitness is a dynamic platform that empowers users to share and explore real-time events through the eyes of eyewitnesses. Capture the essence of local happenings, breaking news, and unique perspectives, all on an interactive map-driven interface.**

## How does it work?

**iWitness enables users to share location-based articles, represented as markers on the map. Those within a 1km radius can vote to approve or disapprove, while users outside this range can comment but not vote, preventing the spread of misinformation. The size of the marker increases with more local approvals**

## Todo:

* Server...Saving posts based on coordinate chunks
* User token reservation for the day, users doesnt have accounts(because that way a person can be connected to a coordinate), they reserve tokens each day on the first login of the site.
